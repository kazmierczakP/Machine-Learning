    "# N-gams Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "`n-grams language model` is a `statistical model` used in natural language processing (NLP) to predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous n – 1 words. It’s one of the simplest and most fundamental approaches to language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-gram:\n",
    "$$ P(w_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Bi-gram:\n",
    "$$ P(w_i∣w_{i−1})=\\frac{count(w_{i−1},w_i)}{count(w_{i−1})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Tri-gram:\n",
    "$$ P(w_i∣w_{i−1},w_{i−2})=\\frac{count(w_{i−2},w_{i−1},w_i)}{count(w_{i−1},w_{i−2})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(w_i,w_{i−1},w_{i−2}) = P(w_{i-2}) \\cdot P(w_{i−1}|w_{i-2}) \\cdot P(w_{i}|(w_{i−2},w_{i-1})) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov assumption \n",
    "`Markov assumption` -  only last n words matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tri-gram simplification: $$ P(w_i,w_{i−1},w_{i−2}) \\approx P(w_{i-2}) \\cdot P(w_{i-1}∣w_{i−2}) \\cdot P(w_{i-2}∣w_{i−1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While n-gram models are still used for autocomplete, speech recognition, and baseline NLP tasks, they’ve largely been replaced by `neural language models` (e.g., RNNs, Transformers) that can capture long-range dependencies and semantic meaning.\n",

    "#### Starting and Ending sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of each sentence fo `n-gram` algorith we add `n-1 start signs` $<s>$ in order to be able to have n-gram probability for first word in a text (to generalize).\n",

    "    \n",
    "At the end of sentence we add `only one end sign` $</s>$ to have n-grams for each ending sentence word."
